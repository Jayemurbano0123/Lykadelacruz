<h5><strong>Elizabeth Corcoran:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0">What's been Microsoft's biggest innovation</p>

<h5><strong>Bill Gates:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0">The most innovative thing in our industry was the idea of creating a software industry around the personal computer</p>

  <h5><strong>Elizabeth Corcoran:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0"> What are you reading these days? </p>        
      <h5><strong>Bill Gates:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0">
    I read a lot. I read<i> Who’s Teaching Your Children? </i> That was super-good. And all these disease books. 
</p>    
        <h5><strong>Elizabeth Corcoran:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0"> Is it OK not to be the richest man anymore? </p>  

          
     <h5><strong>Bill Gates:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0">
    Sure. I gave $36 Billion to my foundation. That’s how I did it, right? So obviously, I don’t care. 
</p>         
    <h5><strong>Elizabeth Corcoran:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0"> You’re taking classes online? </p>  
<h5><strong>Bill Gates:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0">
    I love the lectures that are showing for free online—and some you can buy commercially at 
<a href=“http://www.Teach12.com">www.Teach12.com </a>Some of these lectures are incredible, and very high quality. In terms of the free stuff, MIT has 
physics classes that are very well known by [Walter] Lewin, and [Eric] Lander on biology. And there’s a chemistry 
course by Don Satterway that is very, very good. 
</p>  
 <h5><strong>Elizabeth Corcoran:</strong></h5>
<p id="p0">And what’s your prediction about a new device we’ll be using 
10 years from now? </p>  
    <h5>Footnote</h5>        
 <center><p id="p0"> This interview was conducted just a week before Bill Gates stepped down as Chairman of the Board of Microsoft Corporation, at age 52. The 
legendary entrepreneur and <br> technologist will focus all his energy in his own foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation.</p>
